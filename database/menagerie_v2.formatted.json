The Alumental is a thing of both magic and engineering, being sculpted largely of clay and metal, but powered by The Flow.\n\nWhile not expensive to make, they are extremely expensive to power, as they require a source of Divination Magic, and Elemental Magic, and require a name to be placed alongside the magic in its chest, written on the leather of a draconic creature, which does not burn like the other items.  \n\nThe construct will seek and destroy the named target it has written.  While within its detecting range (variable due to the strength of the divination magics it has been provided), it will know where you are, and will expend its magics to power itself.  The magics can last months to years.  \n\nDue to the burning effect of the divination and elemental magics, people who attempt to stop or approach Alumentals experience vivid hallucinations of their past and future, wreathed in the elemental magic that was added.\n\nThe only way to truly destroy the Alumental is to find its Core Instructions in the deepest of its hearts, plunging your hand into the wet, oily, blood-like chambers of machinery and braving the very dangers that lie within.

The drained can never see the true form, and become fascinated and overprotective of the Maladite, so much that they will protect it with their life.\n\nThe Maladite has extreme physical and magical resistance to those that cannot truly see it.  Magical divinations, detections and illusion dispels are twisted, such that the magic user knows that something is up, but cannot glean real information about it.\n\nThe Maladite’s true form can only be seen freely by one who truly wants for nothing, though burning Palomile and Gandra also dispels its Illusory Form.",

Initially this is done by overlapping their ethereal form with another, and eventually they can do when near, and then afar.  Each time they do so successfully, they grow in power.\n\nParticularly powerful Remembrances - ones that have built themselves memories in the minds of others - have a chaotic, evil persona, and strive for larger and more wide-spread memories.\n\nThe ironic condition of the Remembrance is that the more it successfully uses Memory Overlay - it's preference when threatened into combat - the more it solidifies and becomes succeptible to physical attacks.",
