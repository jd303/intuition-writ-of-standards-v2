While within its detecting range (variable due to the strength of the divination magics it has been provided), it will know where you are, and will expend its magics to power itself.  The magics can last months to years.  \n\nDue to the burning effect of the divination and elemental magics, people who attempt to stop or approach Alumentals experience vivid hallucinations of their past and future, wreathed in the elemental magic that was added.\n\nThe only way to truly destroy the Alumental is to find its Core Instructions in the deepest of its hearts, plunging your hand into the wet, oily, blood-like chambers of machinery and braving the very dangers that lie within.

They cannot remember who they are, and so take the form of someone they see at their death or near after, though there is something off about their look, and they imitate them poorly.\n\nThe Remembrance has a deep urge to remember, and so they use the remants of their psionic abilities to insert memories of their new forme into those around them, in the hopes of building a new existence.  Initially this is done by overlapping their ethereal form with another, and eventually they can do when near, and then afar.  Each time they do so successfully, they grow in power.\n\nParticularly powerful Remembrances - ones that have built themselves memories in the minds of others - have a chaotic, evil persona, and strive for larger and more wide-spread memories.\n\nThe ironic condition of the Remembrance is that the more it successfully uses Memory Overlay - it's preference when threatened into combat - the more it solidifies and becomes succeptible to physical attacks.",
